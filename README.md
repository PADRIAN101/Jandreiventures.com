# My Personal Wesbite- Jandreiventures.com [CMSC 207 Mini Project]
Jandreiventures.com is a one-pager personal website that describes something about me and what I do aside from work and school. It is inspired from the step-by-step coding book written by Clyde Hatter. The website layouts the simple information about me, my interests and my contact details. The following are features and their brief descriptions, respectively. 

## Website Structure
- **Header: JANDREIVENTURES.COM/ by Jan Adrian Pardinas-**
I used gradient color of teal and blue as my theme. I chose this color because it represents calmness and tranquility when browsing the page. I want it to look simple and not overcrowded with many elements. 
- **Navigation: About Me, Interests & Contact**
- **About Me:** A short paragraph that defines why I chose “Jandreiventures” as the name of my website. I also included my work background, where I live and what I believe in life. Moreover, I showcased not just one picture but a gallery of moments, experience and places I have been to. 
- **Interests:** I featured few hobbies that interests me a lot. These are writing, running and travelling. 
- **Contact:** I displayed a small facial photo and contact details where can I be reached through. I also included links to my social media accounts such as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.

## Short Reflection:

### Challenges I encountered:

The challenges that held me back to progress in finishing the mini-project was the screen compatibility feature. Initially, I designed my HTML on a desktop screen without even thinking about the compatibility to small device as I have thought that I can just do it in the last phase of the project. To my surprise, it took me a lot of rework because one change in one style sometimes would affect everything because there is a scarcity of space. I had to review from the start so I would know which of the CSS styles were the ones affecting the screen compatibility. Should I have known better about the amount of work to clean up the mess I did. I would have taken a different approach. I think this one of the experiences I had to learn the hard way.  

### Things I learned from this Mini-project:
In connection to the biggest challenge I faced about screen compatibility feature, I realized that there’s a silver lining behind it. It taught me patience and foresight. Patience in the sense that I will not be able to finish my project if I did start reviewing my codes from the start. At the same time, foresight. That by overcoming this challenge, it would teach me to take a lesson out of it. I should have started reviewing my screen compatibility styles every step using a browser’s inspect feature. This is where I could see my screen in different device screen. Overall, time was friend. It gave me enough chances to correct my mistakes. Next time, I’ll keep this in mind.
