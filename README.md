# My Personal Wesbite- Jandreiventures.com [CMSC 207 Mini Project]
Jandreiventures.com is a one-pager personal website that describes something about me and what I do aside from work and school. It is inspired from the step-by-step coding book written by Clyde Hatter. The website layouts the simple information about me, my interests and my contact details. The following are features and their brief descriptions, respectively. 

## Website Structure
- **Header: JANDREIVENTURES.COM/ by Jan Adrian Pardinas**
I used gradient color of teal and blue as my theme. I chose this color because it represents calmness and tranquility when browsing the page. I want it to look simple and not overcrowded with many elements. 
- **Navigation: About Me, Interests & Contact**
- **About Me:** A short paragraph that defines why I chose “Jandreiventures” as the name of my website. I also included my work background, where I live and what I believe in life. Moreover, I showcased not just one picture but a gallery of moments, experience and places I have been to. 
- **Interests:** I featured few hobbies that interests me a lot. These are writing, running and travelling. 
- **Contact:** I displayed a small facial photo and contact details where can I be reached through. I also included links to my social media accounts such as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.
